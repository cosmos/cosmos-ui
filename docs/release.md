# Creating a Cosmos Voyager Release

### Automatic Release

When you're ready to publish a release, push code to the `release` branch.
CircleCI will notice and automatically increment the patch level of the version
number, create a tag, and generate a pull request. If the pull request is
merged then CircleCI will use it to build applications for all three platforms and publish a release on GitHub.

### Manual Release

If the CI is broken, you can also manually release. Therefor you need a GitHub access token with simple repository rights.

First create the release candidate:
`GIT_BOT_TOKEN={TOKEN} node tasks/releasePullRequest.js`

If this is merged, checkout the new develop. Then cleanup the release folder:
`rm -rf ./builds/Voyager`

Now build Voyager (checkout the <a href="../README.md#build-gaia">README.md</a> for how to build).

Now you publish the release:
`GIT_BOT_TOKEN={TOKEN} node tasks/publish.js`

### Verifying Builds with the Team

> **Note:** This is a work in progress

As a team, we should verify that we all independently arrived at the same result
for each of the builds, which greatly increases security by reducing the chances
that a build was backdoored by an attacker who has compromised one of our
machines. (When dealing with huge sums of money, we can never be too careful).

1.  Make a production build (see how in <a href="../README.md#build-gaia">README.md</a>).
1.  Paste the output from the previous commands into Slack and ensure everyone
    has matching hashes.
1.  As a team, run the app at least once on each platform to double-check that
    the builds were done correctly.
1.  Enjoy the dopamine and serotonin flooding your brain.

### Signing Builds

> **Note:** This is a work in progress

In the future, we will each have private keys to sign the builds, so that users
can trust new versions when updating (either manually or with an auto-update
feature).

We will also have a company key for macOS signatures, for extra security and so
users aren't warned about the app being untrusted.
