# Voyager Update: "Onboard with Onboarding"

Sprint of March 6 - 20, 2018

Welcome to the first of a regular bi-monthly Voyager update! The Cosmos Voyager team plans out a number of new features and bug fixes to be accomplished every two weeks. This update will give you an executive summary of the improvements and fixes.

## Additions

* We welcomed David "NodeGuy" Braun to our team. David previously worked at Monax.
* We defined the required features of the Voyager MVP.
* We defined the primary customers of the Voyager MVP -- investors and crypto beginners.
* We were blocked by gaia-2 stability issues, so we rebuilt the mock server so that developers and users can test Voyager without a testnet.
* We're prioritizing deterministic builds, so we decided to containerize Voyager with Docker.

## Bug Fixes

* We fixed an issue with sorting validators.

## In Progress

* We identified the importance of onboarding new users, so we've been working on an onboarding wizard for Voyager.

That's all for this sprint. Thanks for reading!
